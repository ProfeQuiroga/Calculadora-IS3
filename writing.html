        <h1>Mike in Writing</h1>

        <p>The following details some of the writing projects where I've written about IT.</p>

        <p>
        <h2>More Agile Testing</h2>

        <p>Mike was both a lead reviewer and contributor to Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregories book More Agile Testing.</p>

        <p>
        <h2>How To Test(Free)</h2>

        <p>With a lot of people interested in becoming a tester, Mike wanted to create a free resource which would allow people to explore the basics of being a tester.</p>
        <p>The book focuses on the day-to-day of being a tester, particularly focusing on heuristics and how to apply to a webpage under test.</p>
        <p>Mike uses this book to coach people new to testing.</p>

        <p>
        <h2>The Elf Who Learned How To Test(Free)</h2>

        <p>At the North Pole, a group of elves working for Santa try to learn how to build and deliver the right toys.</p>
        <p>This is a series of four whimsical stories meant for children and adults alike.</p>
        <p>One of Mike's favourite creations, they are parables for modern IT challenges. The stories weave together the challenges of <q>how testing contributes</q> <q>working with people who are different to you</q>, <q>knowing what to build</q> and finally <q>working across boundaries</q>.</p>

        <p>
        <h2>Mike Talks Medium Site</h2>

        <p>I recently moved to Medium as it allowed me to split up my writing a bit more, and also looks "fresher" than the Blogspot format.</p>

			<h2>Wargames (Screen Testing)</h2>

			<p>The 1983 movie Wargames was highly influential on me. <a href="http://testsheepnz.blogspot.com/2014/02/programming-it-was-acceptable-in-80s.html">I'd recieved my first computer the year before</a>, and had taken my first steps into programming <i>(I remember programming my first algorithms to make maths homework easier - oh the joy!)</i></p>
			<p><a href="https://testingpodcast.com/category/screen-testing/">In this podcast with Dan Billing and Neil Studd</a>, we revisit the film, asking if it still holds up today ...</p>

			<h2>Biscuit Testing - A Scientific Approach (Testing Talks)</h2>

			<p>In this podcast from Testing Talks, I was interviewed by Joe Colantonio to explain what I called a <q>biscuit testing</q> approach to testing systems.</p>
			<p>To find out what I mean by that, you'll have to listen to the recording ...</p>

			<h2>Better Unit Testing (Test Automation Guild 2018)</h2>

			<p>My team created this video of an exploration of the Panther fuel calculator problem which we'd previously run as a workshop.</p>
			<p>In the video, two of my team show an approach of how to work through such a testing challenge together. We've recieved high praise for this video for showing how pair programming and testing should work.</p>

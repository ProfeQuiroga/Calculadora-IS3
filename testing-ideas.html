			<p>Welcome to Oblique Testing!</p>
			<p>These cards are based on the ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies">Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies</a>.</p>
			<p>Each card represents a one-star review of your system. The aim is to assume the comment is valid, and revist your testing to determine how you'd attempt to discover that problem.</p>
			<p>The aim of the cards is to prevent our testing getting into a rut, and approach differently and inventively. The cards can also be used to help check a test approach for any holes in coverage.</p>
			<p>Buy the book for more details on <a href="https://leanpub.com/obliquetesting">Oblique Testing here</a>.</p>
